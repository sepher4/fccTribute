    -Your tribute page should have a main element with a corresponding id of main, which contains all other elements
    -You should see an element with an id of title, which contains a string (i.e. text), that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug")
    -You should see either a figure or a div element with an id of img-div
    -Within the #img-div element, you should see an img element with a corresponding id="image"
    -Within the #img-div element, you should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in #img-div
    -You should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page
    You should see an a element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site, that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to _blank in order for your link to open in a new tab
    Your #image should use max-width and height properties to resize responsively, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size
    Your img element should be centered within its parent element

            <ul>
                <li>December 10, 1815: Ada Lovelace is born in London, England. She is the daughter of the poet Lord Byron and his wife, Anne Isabella Milbanke.</li>
                <li>1828: Lovelace meets the mathematician Charles Babbage, who shows her his plans for a "Difference Engine," an early mechanical calculator.</li>
                <li>1833: Lovelace begins corresponding with Babbage about his ideas for a more advanced machine, which he calls the "Analytical Engine." She becomes increasingly fascinated by the machine and begins to work on developing a method for using it to perform calculations.</li>
                <li>1842: Lovelace translates an article about the Analytical Engine by the Italian mathematician Luigi Menabrea from French to English. She adds extensive notes to the article, which are later published as "Notes on the Analytical Engine." In these notes, Lovelace describes a method for using the machine to calculate Bernoulli numbers, and also speculates about the future potential of computing machines.</li>
                <li>1843: Lovelace writes to Babbage about a vision she has had of the Analytical Engine being used to compose music. She suggests that the machine could be programmed to produce music based on mathematical rules, and argues that this would not only be a valuable artistic pursuit, but could also lead to new insights into the nature of music and mathematics.</li>
                <li>1852: Lovelace dies of cancer at the age of 36. Her contributions to the development of computing are largely forgotten for many years, but begin to be rediscovered in the 20th century.</li>
                <li>1980: The United States Department of Defense creates a new computer programming language and names it "Ada" in honor of Lovelace.</li>
                <li>1991: The Association for Women in Computing establishes the Ada Lovelace Award to recognize women who have made significant contributions to the field of computing.</li>
                <li>2009: Lovelace is posthumously inducted into the Women's Hall of Fame in Seneca Falls, New York.</li>
                <li>2015: Lovelace's bicentennial birthday is celebrated with a variety of events, including a Google Doodle and a conference at the University of Oxford.</li>
